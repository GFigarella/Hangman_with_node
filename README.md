# Hangman_with_node

This assignment will make a hangman game using node.js and applying the concept of constructors.

### How the game works

Once the game starts, the user will be given a word that he/she has to guess.
There will be a limited amount of guesses.
When the word is successfully guessed, or there are no more attempts to guess, the user will be prompted to play again or to quit the game.

This assignment contains a package.json file which will hold all our needed dependencies

The entrypoint will be a file (hangman.js) that will require all the necessary constructors for the game, and call the function that will actually run the game. 

Most of the logic behind the game will be contained in other files, in different constructors.

### Playing the game
